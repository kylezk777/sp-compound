# Visual Companion Guide

Browser-based visual brainstorming companion for showing mockups, diagrams, and options.

## When to Use

Decide per-question, not per-session. The test: **would the user understand this better by seeing it than reading it?**

**Use the browser** when the content itself is visual:

- **UI mockups** — wireframes, layouts, navigation structures, component designs
- **Architecture diagrams** — system components, data flow, relationship maps
- **Side-by-side visual comparisons** — comparing two layouts, two color schemes, two design directions
- **Design polish** — when the question is about look and feel, spacing, visual hierarchy
- **Spatial relationships** — state machines, flowcharts, entity relationships rendered as diagrams

**Use the terminal** when the content is text or tabular:

- **Requirements and scope questions** — "what does X mean?", "which features are in scope?"
- **Conceptual A/B/C choices** — picking between approaches described in words
- **Tradeoff lists** — pros/cons, comparison tables
- **Technical decisions** — API design, data modeling, architectural approach selection
- **Clarifying questions** — anything where the answer is words, not a visual preference

A question *about* a UI topic is not automatically a visual question. "What kind of wizard do you want?" is conceptual — use the terminal. "Which of these wizard layouts feels right?" is visual — use the browser.

## How It Works

The server watches a directory for HTML files and serves the newest one to the browser. You write HTML content to `screen_dir`, the user sees it in their browser and can click to select options. Selections are recorded to `state_dir/events` that you read on your next turn.

**Content fragments vs full documents:** If your HTML file starts with `<!DOCTYPE` or `<html`, the server serves it as-is (just injects the helper script). Otherwise, the server automatically wraps your content in the frame template — adding the header, CSS theme, selection indicator, and all interactive infrastructure. **Write content fragments by default.** Only write full documents when you need complete control over the page.

## Starting a Session

```bash
# Start server with persistence (mockups saved to project)
scripts/start-server.sh --project-dir /path/to/project

# Returns: {"type":"server-started","port":52341,"url":"http://localhost:52341",
#           "screen_dir":"/path/to/project/.sp-compound/brainstorm/12345-1706000000/content",
#           "state_dir":"/path/to/project/.sp-compound/brainstorm/12345-1706000000/state"}
```

Save `screen_dir` and `state_dir` from the response. Tell user to open the URL.

**Finding connection info:** The server writes its startup JSON to `$STATE_DIR/server-info`. If you launched the server in the background and didn't capture stdout, read that file to get the URL and port.

**Note:** Pass the project root as `--project-dir` so mockups persist in `.sp-compound/brainstorm/` and survive server restarts. Without it, files go to `/tmp` and get cleaned up. Remind the user to add `.sp-compound/` to `.gitignore` if it's not already there.

If the URL is unreachable from your browser (common in remote/containerized setups), bind a non-loopback host:

```bash
scripts/start-server.sh \
  --project-dir /path/to/project \
  --host 0.0.0.0 \
  --url-host localhost
```

## The Loop

1. **Check server is alive**, then **write HTML** to a new file in `screen_dir`:
   - Before each write, check that `$STATE_DIR/server-info` exists. If it doesn't (or `$STATE_DIR/server-stopped` exists), the server has shut down — restart it with `start-server.sh` before continuing. The server auto-exits after 30 minutes of inactivity.
   - Use semantic filenames: `platform.html`, `visual-style.html`, `layout.html`
   - **Never reuse filenames** — each screen gets a fresh file
   - Use Write tool — **never use cat/heredoc** (dumps noise into terminal)
   - Server automatically serves the newest file

2. **Tell user what to expect and end your turn:**
   - Remind them of the URL (every step, not just first)
   - Give a brief text summary of what's on screen (e.g., "Showing 3 layout options for the homepage")
   - Ask them to respond in the terminal: "Take a look and let me know what you think. Click to select an option if you'd like."

3. **On your next turn** — after the user responds in the terminal:
   - Read `$STATE_DIR/events` if it exists — this contains the user's browser interactions (clicks, selections) as JSON lines
   - Merge with the user's terminal text to get the full picture
   - The terminal message is the primary feedback; `state_dir/events` provides structured interaction data

4. **Iterate or advance** — if feedback changes current screen, write a new file (e.g., `layout-v2.html`). Only move to the next question when the current step is validated.

5. **Unload when returning to terminal** — when the next step doesn't need the browser, push a waiting screen:

   ```html
   <!-- filename: waiting.html (or waiting-2.html, etc.) -->
   <div style="display:flex;align-items:center;justify-content:center;min-height:60vh">
     <p class="subtitle">Continuing in terminal...</p>
   </div>
   ```

6. Repeat until done.

## Writing Content Fragments

Write just the content that goes inside the page. The server wraps it in the frame template automatically.

**Minimal example:**

```html
<h2>Which layout works better?</h2>
<p class="subtitle">Consider readability and visual hierarchy</p>

<div class="options">
  <div class="option" data-choice="a" onclick="toggleSelect(this)">
    <div class="letter">A</div>
    <div class="content">
      <h3>Single Column</h3>
      <p>Clean, focused reading experience</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="option" data-choice="b" onclick="toggleSelect(this)">
    <div class="letter">B</div>
    <div class="content">
      <h3>Two Column</h3>
      <p>Sidebar navigation with main content</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

No `<html>`, no CSS, no `<script>` tags needed. The server provides all of that.

## CSS Classes Available

### Options (A/B/C choices)

```html
<div class="options">
  <div class="option" data-choice="a" onclick="toggleSelect(this)">
    <div class="letter">A</div>
    <div class="content"><h3>Title</h3><p>Description</p></div>
  </div>
</div>
```

**Multi-select:** Add `data-multiselect` to the container.

### Cards (visual designs)

```html
<div class="cards">
  <div class="card" data-choice="design1" onclick="toggleSelect(this)">
    <div class="card-image"><!-- mockup content --></div>
    <div class="card-body"><h3>Name</h3><p>Description</p></div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Mockup container / Split view / Pros-Cons / Mock elements

```html
<div class="mockup"><div class="mockup-header">Preview</div><div class="mockup-body">...</div></div>
<div class="split"><div class="mockup">...</div><div class="mockup">...</div></div>
<div class="pros-cons"><div class="pros"><h4>Pros</h4><ul>...</ul></div><div class="cons"><h4>Cons</h4><ul>...</ul></div></div>
<div class="mock-nav">Logo | Home | About</div>
<button class="mock-button">Action</button>
<input class="mock-input" placeholder="Input">
<div class="placeholder">Placeholder area</div>
```

## Browser Events Format

User interactions are recorded to `$STATE_DIR/events` (one JSON object per line). Cleared when a new screen is pushed.

```jsonl
{"type":"click","choice":"a","text":"Option A - Simple Layout","timestamp":1706000101}
{"type":"click","choice":"b","text":"Option B - Hybrid","timestamp":1706000115}
```

The last `choice` event is typically the final selection. If `$STATE_DIR/events` doesn't exist, the user didn't interact with the browser.

## Design Tips

- Scale fidelity to the question — wireframes for layout, polish for polish questions
- Explain the question on each page — not just "Pick one"
- Iterate before advancing — if feedback changes current screen, write a new version
- 2-4 options max per screen
- Use real content when it matters (e.g., Unsplash images for a portfolio)

## Cleaning Up

```bash
scripts/stop-server.sh $SESSION_DIR
```

Mockup files persist in `.sp-compound/brainstorm/` for later reference when `--project-dir` was used.
